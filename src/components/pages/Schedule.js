      Our open-gyms take place at various high schools around Montgomery County,
      with the specific location changing each week. Similarly, the times vary,
      so itâ€™s essential to check the schedule regularly. During open-gyms, we
      limit the number of teams to about three per court to ensure everyone gets
      ample playing time. They fill up fast, so it is best to sign up as soon as
      possible! To sign up, message us on Instagram at

      whether you have a full team, a small group of friends, or are coming
      alone; we will do our best to find you a spot to play. When messaging us,
      be sure to include the names of all your friends and the positions they
      play. Each open-gym costs $10 per player.
