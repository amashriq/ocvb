          OC Volleyball started with one goal in mind: bringing back high level,
          consistent, 6v6 volleyball to the DMV. After hosting countless
          Open-Gyms and Tournaments, OC Volleyball, along with its wonderful
          community, was able to build a reputation. Now, when you think of the
          best way to access top level volleyball in Maryland, whether itâ€™s to
          practice or compete, you think OC.
